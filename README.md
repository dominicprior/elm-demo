# elm-demo
My first Elm program!

A blob follows the mouse cursor round the screen, demonstrating SVG and mouse and timer events.

To build and run this program:

* install Node.js and Elm

* cd to this folder and run elm-reactor (which starts a Node.js server for you)

* visit the server in a browser on localhost:8000

* click on the blob.elm link
